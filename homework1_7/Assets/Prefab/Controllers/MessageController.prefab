  - "Item #: SCP-087\r\n\r\nObject Class: Euclid\r\n\r\nSpecial Containment Procedures:
    SCP-087 is located on the campus of [REDACTED]. The doorway leading to SCP-087
    is constructed of reinforced steel with an electro-release lock mechanism. It
    has been disguised to resemble a janitorial closet consistent with the design
    of the building. The lock mechanism on the doorknob will not release unless \u2588\u2588
    volts are applied in conjunction with counter-clockwise rotation of the key.
    The inside of the door is lined with 6 centimeters of industrial foam padding.\r\n\r\nDue
    to the results of the final exploration (see Document 087-IV), no personnel are
    permitted access to SCP-087."
  - 'Description: SCP-087 is an unlit platform staircase. Stairs descend on a 38
    degree angle for 13 steps before reaching a semicircular platform of approximately
    3 meters in diameter. Descent direction rotates 180 degrees at each platform.
    The design of SCP-087 limits subjects to a visual range of approximately 1.5
    flights. A light source is required for any subjects exploring SCP-087, as there
    are no lighting fixtures or windows present. Lighting sources brighter than 75
    watts have shown to be ineffective, as SCP-087 seems to absorb excess light.'
